* Non-integer counts in `df$y` due to the use of survey weights
* Currently using `round(df$y)` but this is an unsatisfying solution
* In `stan` and `TMB` a custom continous version of the binomial likelihood could be implemented
* In `R-INLA` there is the `xbinomial` function for non-integer counts
    * Be warned that this may make the marginal likelihood not interpretable as it is not clear what to do with the normalising constant
* Keywords to investigate
    * Bayesian pseudo likelihood
